# Car Showroom Lead Intelligence System – Indore

## Overview

The Car Showroom Lead Intelligence System is a data-driven project developed to identify potential business leads among car showrooms in Indore. The system automatically gathers showroom information, analyzes their online presence, extracts contact details, and categorizes businesses based on lead potential.

The objective of the project is to help sales and marketing teams identify businesses that may benefit from digital services by highlighting showrooms with limited online visibility.

This project was developed during a Data Science Internship at Positiveway Solutions Pvt Ltd.

## Project Workflow

The system follows a multi-step pipeline:

1. Collects car showroom data from OpenStreetMap.
2. Searches for each showroom online using DuckDuckGo Search.
3. Checks whether the showroom has an official website or relies mainly on referral platforms.
4. Extracts phone numbers using automated web searches.
5. Assigns a lead score based on online presence.
6. Displays the results through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

* Hot Lead: Businesses with little or no online presence and no official website.
* High Priority: Businesses with limited digital visibility and few referral listings.
* Medium Priority: Businesses with some online presence but room for improvement.
* Low Priority: Businesses that already have a website but still show minor gaps.
